## WELCOME TO FARMAKART!

FarmKart is a project carried out by a group of three developers, one project manager and five designers. It is as a result of several brainstorming session between the team to provide unique solution to problems that is facing sales of agricultural produce in rural and urban areas thereby eliminating the need for middlemen.

WIth this technology, consumers get to buy fresh farm produce and the seller get fast returns on their investment - At the end of the day, everybody is happy.

TOOLS

The design process uses figma to produce the visually appealing yet user friendly user interfaces.
The development process used pure HTML, CSS and javascript during the initial development process but after a while, it was shipped to the most recent NextJS React Framework.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

The frontend uses NextJS, a production framework built on top of react. The following libraries are used:

1. React-hook-Form - for form management.
2. React-Toastify - for push notification.
3. Axios - for API calls.
4. Framer-Motion - for Animation.
5. React-Icons - for icons management.
6. Flowbite - for react components like modals and carousel.
7. tailwindcss - for styling.
8. react-convetti

The backend utilizes the NextJS capibility to embed server-side code in its codebase. The following libraries are used:

1. Prisma - for object relational mapping which used postgressql as a database provider.
2. Next-auth - for authentication.
3. Stripe - for payment management.

## PROJECT STATUS

Ongoing

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
